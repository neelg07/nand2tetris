# [From Nand to Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/software)
Building a Modern Computer From First Principles


* Book: [The Elements of Computing Systems](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/elements-computing-systems)
* Instructors: Shimon Schocken & Noam Nissan

## Overview
This project is from the MOOC course nand2tetris. From building basic elementary logic gates to writing a high level language and operating system, this course will teach me how to build a modern-day, all-purpose PC from the ground up. By digging deep into the implementations behind the multi-layered abstractions used to create the hardware and software, I hope to reach a higher understanding behind the lower-level processes that make up today's computing world.
